    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <p>This is a quiz on self discipline. While looking at other ones, I thought" what quiz
    can you make on discipline?", thinking the same thought would be in the others
mind, I <strong><i>CODED</i></strong> this quiz myself. THis is a kind of self development quiz, only three results are possible:
<br> 1. The Elegant - Always/Mostly Discipline<br>
2. The Miserable - Tries to be Discipline but cannot<br>
3. The Unbothered - Not Discipline, nor does he/she care<br>

Questions will come, with options A, B, and C. Quickly jot down the answer (either A, B or C) on a rough piece of paper or simply open Notepad. There is no raise hand needed. Just jot it. If you are unable to do it within the given time(7 seconds per question), the link in the chat is always for your reference</p>
